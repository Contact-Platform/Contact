# CONTACT - STAY CLOSE, WE ARE WORKING ON A NEW VERSION!!!

## What is CONTACT?
An open platform that brings together software and hardware to allow everyone to communicate up to eight mile radius.


## Why did we create CONTACT?
During and after an emergency the communication communities is critical. Helping people at all levels to communicate empowers them to recognize important issues and find common grounds for action, and builds a sense of identity and participation in order to implement decisions.

Well-conceived and effectively delivered emergency messages can help ensure public safety, protect property, facilitate response efforts, elicit cooperation, instill public confidence, and help families reunite.

> Delivering effective emergency communications is an essential part of emergency management. We have learned through the experience of Hurricane Maria first that the people around you respond more quickly than the government. Second, although government assistance is available, coordination between people and agencies is needed, and communication is necessary for this.

In emergency situations it is important to know the needs and emotions of all involved, but process all the field data its practically imposible.  For that reason, our solution, it is also designed to help you understand what your users are saying. By using an *Artificially Inteligence* system and a group of powerful tools on the *Cloud*, created by IBM, our solution can receives messages and analyzes them for sentiment,  emotional tone and identify the repeating keywords in the conversations. Storing all the data in a database and visualize it through charts, graphs and maps can help you make appropriate and informed decisions on emergency situations and logistics understanding what people needs and their emotions.
