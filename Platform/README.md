# Contact's Unit

Contact combines the use of an IoT device that includes to provide communication access up to eight miles away.

## How Contact's elements work in between?

There are technologies defined for particular developments. But the greatest benefit of technology is in the development of Open Information Systems. Contact was developed thinking about solving perhaps the biggest problem in a natural disaster, the lack of services that allow communication. 
Contact offers an embedded application to allow communication. But contact is not just an application and a communication device, it is a platform that allows increasing the support of communications between people in need and the rest of the planet. Contact allows to develop and integrate other interfaces for data capture in a simple way using technologies similar to RESTful or HTML injection
