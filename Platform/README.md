# Contact's Unit

Contact combines the use of an IoT device that includes a LoRa transmitter and an ESP32 microcontroller to provide communication access up to eight miles away.

To be able to use the capacity of this device to the maximum, an elaborated coding is necessary.

This is why the integration of multiple programming languages ​​such as C++, HTML, Javascript and CSS is necessary. In addition to the use of tools that facilitate the integration of all these.

The Contact code is divided into two layers. 
- The first layer is used to give instructions to the IoT device and is developed in C++. 
- The second layer allows all the communication functions between the devices and the interaction with the device by the user. This second layer is encoded in HTML, Javascript and CSS.

## Contact's Code
### Communication and Instruction Process
The device has two hardware components. A LoRa module that allows the transmission of data over long distances and an ESP32 microcontroller that allows the process of instructions, create a web server, accept Wi-Fi communication and other functions such as adding a GPS module.

- It is possible to reach *up to 8 miles* away in a communication. Within cities with buildings or structures allows a communication of up to two miles, even within structures. But it is possible to double or triple the distance when using the units with a simple MESH.

- Is an alternative way of *taking communications trough hard places*. In most emergency incidents, mainly in natural disasters, geography or lack of access do not allow communication.

### Ease of Access
- The price is very affordable, the cost is $11.00 to produce a unit. But it can be less by producing more units in a bigger scale.

### Hardware Flexibility
- It is *Portable*, it's measure only 3.1 inches (8cm) x 2 inches (5cm). But we know that it can be smaller.

- It uses *rechargeable batteries* (3.7v 3.6aH, 18650) that can extend its use up to *30 continuous hours*. It *can be recharged and used with any power source*, such as power banks for cell phones, small solar panels or the Eton Red Cross Charger.

### Scalability
- It uses a *frequency free of licenses* for Industry, Science and Medicine (900-Mhz frequencies, ISM band) in the United States. But it is possible to select **other LoRa license-free frequencies for other Countries** through a configuration screen.

- It can be *used as an open network platform to send any form data*. It has sending or receiving functions through specific RESTful technology.

- It **can be used as a Network or Internet Gateway** to send all received messages to another network, the Internet,  [Contact API]() or another platform such as Twilio.

- *Beacon and Geolocation Integration*. It allowing it to be used as a Beacon to locate people in other rescue situations. By using a powerful open-technology microcontroller (ESP32) you can extend the capacity of the device while maintaining low cost and performance.

## CALL FOR CODE + CONTACT
We believe that everyone has creative ideas. We, in response to **Call for Code**, develop the **Contact** capabilities around the powerful tools of **IBM Cloud** to demonstrate that it is a powerful platform that can grow.

That is a reason why we provide a complete *Open Communication Platform* that allows others to control the hardware and the data directly; the people can create custom interfaces and even send the data to other platforms.
